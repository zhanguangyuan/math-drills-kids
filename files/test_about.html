        <p>K5 Learning was founded in 2011 to provide learning tools for K-5 kids.&nbsp;Since then, millions of parents,
          tutors&nbsp;and teachers have visited our site and downloaded our materials.</p>

        <p>We continue to focus on providing high quality, free worksheets and inexpensive workbooks for K-5.</p>

        <h2>We believe:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Children's brains are like sponges. They can learn a lot given the opportunity.</li>
          <li>Kids can only reach their potential by learning at their own pace.</li>
          <li>Independent learning builds confidence and good study habits.</li>
          <li>Strong reading and math skills are the basis of all future learning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why worksheets and workbooks?</h2>

        <p>For learning and practicing some skills, we believe a pencil and paper offers&nbsp;unique advantages.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, working on paper encourages children to slow down, read and think.&nbsp; In contrast, the
          way we have learned to use screens promotes scanning, guessing and tapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>As the difficulty of exercises increases, the ability to "work things out" by hand (calculations, drawings,
          underlining words, etc.) in a completely unrestrained fashion is important.&nbsp; It is how people have been
          learning for centuries.</p>

        <p>Completed worksheets also leave a trail of work, instantly comprehensible to a parent, tutor or teacher.</p>

        <p>We recommend that students take a balanced approach combining paper based learning with online programs.</p>
