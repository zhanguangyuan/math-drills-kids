      For learning and practicing some skills, we believe a pencil and paper offers unique advantages.
      First and foremost, working on paper encourages children to slow down, read and think.
      In contrast, the way we have learned to use screens promotes scanning, guessing and tapping.
      As the difficulty of exercises increases, the ability to "work things out" by hand (calculations, drawings, underlining words, etc.)
      in a completely unrestrained fashion is important.  It is how people have been learning for centuries.
      Completed worksheets also leave a trail of work, instantly comprehensible to a parent, tutor or teacher.
      We recommend that students take a balanced approach combining paper based learning with online programs.
